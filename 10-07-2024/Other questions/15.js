// Create a "Mad-libs" game using JavaScript.
// Create a blank page.
// Using a prompt box, prompt the user to supply his or her name.
// Then, using 5 additional prompt boxes, prompt the user to supply 5 words.
// Save each word in a separate variable.
// Then, using document.write() statements, use the information stored in
// variables to display a "Mad-libs" type of story, i.e. create a few paragraphs of
// information in story format.
// Also, prompt the user for a color (i.e. one of the 16 named colors or a hex
// value).
// Store this color in a variable.
// In the "mad libs" story, highlight, using the color supplied by the user, each
// of the words that you previously collected. Do this by surrounding the words
// with <div> tags and using an inline style.
